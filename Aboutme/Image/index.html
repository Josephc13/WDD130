    <h3> My Nickname :Joe </h3>
        <p> Howdy partner, My name is Joseph Christiansen and Im a transfer student from Texas Tech
        and Utah State. Im currently only 20 years old and going into my 4th years of college. Its pretty
        obvious but I do not have grandchildren nor probably will for a hot second. </p>
        <p> I grew up in a navy town in the middle of the Mojave Desert in California. I grew up playing golf
        current getting my PGA card. I also play soccer, volleyball, and lacrose! </p>
        <p> I'm studying Information Technology. I pick this major because the job field is extremely wide and broad which
        means their are some many options in what I can go into. </p>
